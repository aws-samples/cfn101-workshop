## Overview

So far, you have used the console to deploy CloudFormation templates. 
As you have probably noticed, uploading files to S3 manually so you can deploy nested stacks throught the console is tedious.

It is also possible to deploy CloudFormation templates using the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs. In this section, you will learn how to use the AWS CLI to work with CloudFormation templates.
This section will cover three key commands, used to package, validate and deploy CloudFormation templates with the AWS CLI.

## Packaging a template

Cloudformation components often reference external files in S3. An example of this the `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource. The Component requires the target template  to be in S3. What if the external files are on your local machine? In the previous section you uploaded these templates manually to S3 before deploying.

[`aws cloudformation package`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/package.html) is a useful command that solves this problem. When given a template that references local resources, it will upload the resources to a specified S3 bucket. An updated template is output. The local file references in the template are updated to reference the uploaded assets in S3.

This is a required step if you wish to deploy Nested Stacks. These are CloudFormation templates that reference other CloudFormation templates. You will learn this in a future section.

When you package a template, you are required to specify an S3 Bucket to package the contents to.

Here is an example of using the [`aws cloudformation package`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/package.html) command

```bash
aws cloudformation package \
    --template-file code/70-cloudformation-package-and-deploy/01-lab11-deploy.yaml \
    --s3-bucket example-bucket-name \
    --output-template-file code/70-cloudformation-package-and-deploy/01-lab11-deploy-packaged.yaml
```

By default, the updated template is written to the standard output. Use the option `--output-template-file` to specify a path to write the updated CloudFormation template.

Using `aws cloudformation package` you can easily prepare your nested stack for deployment.

## Validating a template

Sometimes a CloudFormation template deployment will fail due to syntax errors in the template.
[`aws cloudformation validate-template`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/validate-template.html) checks a CloudFormation template to ensure it is valid JSON or YAML. This is useful to speed up development time. 

Let's validate a template.

```bash
aws cloudformation validate-template \
    --template-body file://code/70-cloudformation-package-and-deploy/02-lab11-bad-template.yaml
```

Notice what happens!  

Try to fix the errors, then validate the template again.

## Deploying a template using the CLI

The [`aws cloudformation deploy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deploy/index.html) command is used to deploy CloudFormation templates using the CLI.
When used, it requires a template to be passed to it. This can be either a file in S3, or on the local machine.

You can use the `--parameter-overrides` option to specify parameters in the template. This can be  string containing `'key=value'` pairs or a via a [supplied json file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters.html#cli-usage-parameters-json).

Let's deploy a CloudFormation template using the CLI.

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
    --template-file code/70-cloudformation-package-and-deploy/01-lab11-deploy.yaml \
    --stack-name cfn101-lab11-deploy \
    --parameter-overrides "EnvType=Prod" \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

### Capabilities

You may recall when using the console, you are required you to acknowledge that deploying this template may create  resource that can affect permissions in your account. This is to ensure you don't accidentally change the permissions unintentionally.

When using the CLI, you are also required to acknowledge this stack might create resources that can affect IAM permissions. This is done using the `--capabilities` flag, as demonstrated in the previous example. Read more about the possible capabilities in the [`aws cloudformation deploy` documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deploy/index.html)


## Conclusion

Using the CLI is a powerful way to deploy CloudFormation templates. The `package` command simplifies deployment of templates that use features such as nested stacks, or refer to other local assets. The `validate` command can speed up development of templates by catching errors more quickly. The `package` command allows you to deploy CloudFormation templates.

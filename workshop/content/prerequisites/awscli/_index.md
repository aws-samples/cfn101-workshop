The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) allows you to interact with AWS services from a terminal session.
Make sure you have the latest version of the AWS CLI installed on your system.

 * macOS and Linux: [Bundled installer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-bundle.html#install-bundle-other)
 * Windows: [MSI installer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html#install-msi-on-windows)

See the [AWS Command Line Interface installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) page for more details.

## Configure your credentials

Open a terminal window and run `aws configure` to set up your environment.

```shell
$ aws configure
```

Type the **access key ID** and **secret key** you created in [the previous step](/prerequisites/account.html) and choose a
default region (for example you can use `us-east-1`). Preferably use a region that doesn't have any resources already deployed into it.

```shell
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <type key ID here>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <type access key>
Default region name [None]: <choose region (e.g. "us-east-1", "eu-west-1")>
Default output format [None]: <leave blank>
```

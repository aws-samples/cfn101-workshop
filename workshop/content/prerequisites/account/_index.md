## Create an AWS Account for Experimentation

To deploy our app, you'll need access to an AWS account. If you already have an account, and your system is configured
with credentials of an administrator user, you can [move to the next step](../awscli).

If you are using an existing account, either personal or a company account, make sure you understand the implications
and policy of provisioning resources into this account.

If you don't have an AWS account, you can [create a free account here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

## Administrator User

1. Sign in to your AWS account
1. Go to the AWS IAM console and [create a new user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users$new).

Welcome to the **Intermediate** part of the workshop. This part introduces more advanced CloudFormation concepts. You will
learn how to create **nested and layered stacks** and how to **package and deploy** Lambda functions.

In other sections of the **Intermediate** part of the workshop, you will learn about topics that include using [AWS CloudFormation Guard](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard) for policy-as-code validation of any JSON- or YAML-formatted data, including CloudFormation templates, against rules you write.

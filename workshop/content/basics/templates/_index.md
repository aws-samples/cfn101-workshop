In this section, you will be introduced to the basic concepts of AWS CloudFormation.

* CloudFormation allows you to model your infrastructure in a text file. You can use [JSON](https://json.org/) or
  [YAML](https://yaml.org/) to describe what AWS resources you want to create and configure.

* CloudFormation automates the provisioning and updating of your infrastructure in a safe and controlled manner.
  There are no manual steps or controls that can lead to errors.

* CloudFormation is available at no additional charge. You pay only for the AWS resources needed to run your applications.

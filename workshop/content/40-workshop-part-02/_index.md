First, you will learn how to manage multiple stacks, by introducing **[Nested Stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html)** and **[Layered Stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-exports.html)**. Next, you will learn how to **[Package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-package.html)** and **[Deploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-deploy.html)** a _Nested Stack_ using AWS CLI. And finally, you will learn how to write your own CloudFormation **[Custom Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html)**.

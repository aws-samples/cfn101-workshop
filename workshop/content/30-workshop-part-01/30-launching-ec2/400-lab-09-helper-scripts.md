### Overview
In this lab we will look into CloudFormation [Helper Scripts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-helper-scripts-reference.html). 
What you have learned in previous lab is a great starting point. However as you may noticed from your `UserData` example,
procedural scripting is not ideal. You have deployed a simple PHP application, but imagine trying to write much more 
complicated app in userdata. That would be very tricky.

To solve this problem, CloudFormation provides helper scripts. These helper scripts make CloudFormation 
a lot more powerful and enable you to fine tune templates to better fit your use case. For example, you can update application configuration without recreating an instance.

The helper scripts come preinstalled on Amazon Linux and can be updated periodically by using `yum install -y aws-cfn-bootstrap`

### Helper Scripts covered
+ [cfn-init](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-init.html) - Used to retrieve and 
  interpret resource metadata, install packages, create files, and start services.

+ [cfn-hup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-hup.html) - Used to check for updates to 
  metadata and execute custom hooks when changes are detected.
  
+ [cfn-signal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-signal.html) - Used to signal when the
  resource or application is ready.


**Let's start...**

#### Configure _Metadata_ section
You need to use the `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` type to include metadata for an Amazon EC2 instance. When your template calls 
the `cfn-init` script, the script will look for resources in metadata section. Let's add the metadata to your template:
```yaml
  WebServerInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    # Configure Metadata
    Metadata:
      AWS::CloudFormation::Init:
```

#### Configure cfn-init
The configuration of `cfn-init` is separated into sections. The configuration sections are processed in the following
order: packages, groups, users, sources, files, commands, and then services.

{{% notice note %}}
 If you require a different order, separate your sections into different config keys, and then use a [configset](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-init.html?shortFooter=true#aws-resource-init-configsets)
 that specifies the order in which the config keys should be processed.

##### 1. Install HTTPD and PHP packages
Your instance is running Amazon Linux 2, so you will use `yum` package manager to install the packages. 
```yaml
  WebServerInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    # Configure Metadata
    Metadata:
      AWS::CloudFormation::Init:
        # Install HTTPD and PHP packages
        config:
          packages:
            yum:
              httpd: []
              php: []
```

##### 2. Create index.php file
Use the _files_ key to create files on the EC2 instance. The content can either be specified inline in the template, or 
as a URL that is retrieved by the instance.
```yaml
  WebServerInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    # Configure Metadata
    Metadata:
      AWS::CloudFormation::Init:
        # Install HTTPD and PHP packages
        config:
          packages:
            yum:
              httpd: []
              php: []
          # Create /var/www/html/index.php file
          files:
            /var/www/html/index.php:
              content: |
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <body>
                  <center>
    
                    <?php
                    # Get the instance ID from meta-data and store it in the $instance_id variable
                    $url = "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id";
                    $instance_id = file_get_contents($url);
                    # Get the instance's availability zone from metadata and store it in the $zone variable
                    $url = "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone";
                    $zone = file_get_contents($url);
                    ?>
    
                    <h2>EC2 Instance ID: <?php echo $instance_id ?></h2>
                    <h2>Availability Zone: <?php echo $zone ?></h2>
    
                  </center>
                </body>
                </html>
              mode: 000644
              owner: apache
              group: apache
```

##### 3. Enable and start Apache web server
You can use the `services` key to define which services should be enabled or disabled when the instance is launched. On Linux
 systems, this key is supported by using the `sysvinit` key.
```yaml
  WebServerInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    # Configure Metadata
    Metadata:
      AWS::CloudFormation::Init:
        # Install HTTPD and PHP packages
        config:
          packages:
            yum:
              httpd: []
              php: []
          # Create /var/www/html/index.php file
          files:
            /var/www/html/index.php:
              content: {...}
              mode: 000644
              owner: apache
              group: apache
          # Enable and start Apache web server
          services:
            sysvinit:
              httpd:
                enabled: true
                ensureRunning: true
```

##### 4. Call `cfn-init` script
The metadata scripts are not executed by default, you need to call `cfn-init` helper script in UserData section to execute it.
In the code below, first update `aws-cfn-bootstrap` to retrieve the latest version of the helper scripts. Then, install
the files and packages from metadata.
```yaml
      UserData:
        Fn::Base64:
          !Sub |
            #!/bin/bash -xe
            # Update aws-cfn-bootstrap to the latest
            yum install -y aws-cfn-bootstrap
            # Call cfn-init script to install files and packages
            /opt/aws/bin/cfn-init -v --stack ${AWS::StackName} --resource WebServerInstance --region ${AWS::Region}
```
{{% notice note %}}
The intrinsic function `!Sub` will dynamically replace values in `${AWS::StackName}` and `${AWS::Region}` variables.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Configure cfn-hup
Installing the `cfn-hup` helper script enables existing EC2 instances to apply template updates of _UserData_. For example, 
you could change the sample PHP application in the template and deploy this by updating the existing stack. Without using 
`cfn-hup`, you would need to either replace the EC2 instance or manually apply the update outside of CloudFormation. 
(To see this in action, please refer to the exercise section of this lab.)

1. Add two files to the `files` section of the  `AWS::CloudFormation::Init`:

    + /etc/cfn/cfn-hup.conf
    + /etc/cfn/hooks.d/cfn-auto-reloader.conf

    ```yaml
              # Create /var/www/html/index.php file
              files:
                /var/www/html/index.php:
                  content: {...}
                  mode: 000644
                  owner: apache
                  group: apache
              # Create /etc/cfn/cfn-hup.conf
                /etc/cfn/cfn-hup.conf:
                  content: !Sub |
                    [main]
                    stack=${AWS::StackId}
                    region=${AWS::Region}
                    interval=1
                  mode: 000400
                  owner: root
                  group: root
              # Create /etc/cfn/hooks.d/cfn-auto-reloader.conf
                /etc/cfn/hooks.d/cfn-auto-reloader.conf:
                  content: !Sub |
                    [cfn-auto-reloader-hook]
                    triggers=post.update
                    path=Resources.WebServerInstance.Metadata.AWS::CloudFormation::Init
                    action=/opt/aws/bin/cfn-init -s ${AWS::StackName} -r WebServerInstance --region ${AWS::Region}
                    runas=root
    ```

2. Enable and start `cfn-hup` in `services` section of the template.
    ```yaml
              # Enable and start Apache web server
              services:
                sysvinit:
                  httpd:
                    enabled: true
                    ensureRunning: true
              # Enable and start cfn-hup service
                  cfn-hup:
                    enabled: true
                    ensureRunning: true
                    files:
                      - /etc/cfn/cfn-hup.conf
                      - /etc/cfn/hooks.d/cfn-auto-reloader.conf
    ```

#### Configure cfn-signal and CreationPolicy attribute
Finally, you need a way to instruct AWS CloudFormation to complete stack creation only after all the services 
(such as Apache and cfn-hup) are running and not after all the stack resources are created. 

In other words, AWS CloudFormation sets the status of the stack as _CREATE\_COMPLETE_ after it successfully creates all 
the resources. However, if one or more services failed to start, AWS CloudFormation still sets the stack status as 
_CREATE\_COMPLETE_.

To prevent this you can add a [CreationPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html)
attribute to the instance. In conjunction with the creation policy, you need to run the `cfn-signal` helper 
script to notify AWS CloudFormation when all the applications are installed and configured.

1. Add Creation policy to `WebServerInstance` resource
    ```yaml
          UserData:
            Fn::Base64:
              !Sub |
                #!/bin/bash -xe
                # Update aws-cfn-bootstrap to the latest
                yum install -y aws-cfn-bootstrap
                # Call cfn-init script to install files and packages
                /opt/aws/bin/cfn-init -v --stack ${AWS::StackName} --resource WebServerInstance --region ${AWS::Region}
        # Add Creation policy
        CreationPolicy:
          ResourceSignal:
            Count: 1
            Timeout: PT10M
    ```

2. Call cfn-signal from the UserData parameter
    ```yaml
          UserData:
            Fn::Base64:
              !Sub |
                #!/bin/bash -xe
                # Update aws-cfn-bootstrap to the latest
                yum install -y aws-cfn-bootstrap
                # Call cfn-init script to install files and packages
                /opt/aws/bin/cfn-init -v --stack ${AWS::StackName} --resource WebServerInstance --region ${AWS::Region}
                # Call cfn-signal script to send a signal with exit code 
                /opt/aws/bin/cfn-signal --exit-code $? -s ${AWS::StackName} -r WebServerInstance --region ${AWS::Region}

        CreationPolicy:
          ResourceSignal:
            Count: 1
            Timeout: PT10M
    ```

#### Update the stack
To update the stack and apply the changes you have made in the `UserData` property, the EC2 instance needs to be replaced. 

1. Create an `AvailabilityZone` parameter in the template.
    ```yaml
    Parameters:
      AvailabilityZone:
        Type: AWS::EC2::AvailabilityZone::Name
    ```

2. Check the availability zone of the deployed Web Server instance.
 
    + Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2
    + In the left hand pane click _Instances_.
    + Select the `<enviroment Web Server` instance and make a note of the _Availability zone_ value. For example `eu-west-2a`.

3. Update the stack to use a different availability zone than the current one.

#### Exercise

This exercise will demonstrate how `cfn-hup` updates the application when you update the stack. You will update index.php file
 to show AMI ID on the page.

##### 1. Modify index.php file 

Locate the `/var/www/html/index.php` in the _files_ section of the EC2 metadata

Add the code below to the `<\?php {...} ?>` block:
```php
                    # Get the instance AMI ID and store it in the $ami_id variable
                    $url = "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id";
                    $ami_id = file_get_contents($url);
```
Add the code below to html `<h2>` tags:
```html
                    <h2>AMI ID: <?php echo $ami_id ?></h2>
```
##### 2. Update the stack with a new template:

`cfn-hup` will detect changes in metadata section, and will automatically deploy the new version. 

1. Goto the CloudFormation console
1. Select your existing EC2 stack.
1. Update the stack with a new template.

##### 3. Verify that changes has been deployed successfully

Open a new browser window in private mode and enter the `WebsiteURL` (you can get the WebsiteURL from the _Outputs_ tab of the CloudFormation console).
You should see the AMI ID added to the page, similar to the picture below.

Congratulations, you have successfully bootstrapped an EC2 instance using CloudFormation Helper Scripts.

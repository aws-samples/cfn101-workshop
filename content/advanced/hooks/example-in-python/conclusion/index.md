Congratulations! You have built and tested a sample hook in Python! You've learned key concepts, expectations and objectives for you to keep in mind when writing your proactive validation controls with Hooks.

You can see a list of hooks in the public CloudFormation registry when you navigate to the [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), choose **Registry** and then **Public extensions** from the left navigation bar, and then use the filters to list the available hooks.

Also, you can find some existing hooks in the following repositories:
- https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/community-registry-extensions
- https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-samples

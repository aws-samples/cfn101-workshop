Welcome to the **Basic** part of the workshop.

This part will introduce the core concepts of CloudFormation.  You will build an initial template, then improve it in
each lab. You will also learn how to deploy it from the console.

Along the way, you will be introduced to how a template is structured, how to use intrinsic functions and other useful CloudFormation concepts.

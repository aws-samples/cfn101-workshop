AWS Partner Solutions are automated reference deployments for key workloads on the AWS Cloud. Each Partner Solution
launches, configures, and runs the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific
workload on AWS, using AWS best practices for security and availability.

Partner Solutions are accelerators that condense hundreds of manual procedures into just a few steps. They are
customizable and designed for production.
